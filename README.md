# 💤 Dotfiles for Neovim configuration

This is my own Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
\
Its also inspired on [craftz](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/tree/master/.config/nvim) configuration

I am always trying to use less and less the arrow keys
←↑↓→ and switching to vim is my big as.
I'm still using other text editor and IDEs like Intellij
and Vscode cause those are truly great and
don´t need much to think about it, but using vim has been a little bit challenging
and i am learning a lot so i am upgrading this repository putting all dotfiles
configurations here for Neovim.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IvanCCO/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
