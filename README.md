# 💤 Dotfiles for Neovim configuration

This is my own neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)

I am always trying to use less and less the arrow keys ←↑↓→ and switching to vim is my big as.
Im still using other text editor and IDEs like intellij and vscode cause those are truly great and don´t need much to think about it, but using vim has been a little bit challenging
and i am learning a lot so i am upgrading this repository putting all dotfiles configurations here for Neovim.
